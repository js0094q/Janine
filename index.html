        <h2>About Janine</h2>
        <p class="muted">She/Her/Hers</p>
        <p>
          For nearly 20 years, I have provided treatment across multiple settings including private practice, community mental
          health centers, hospitals, schools, yoga studios and in-home treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I obtained my B.A. in Psychology from Rutgers University, followed by graduate degrees in both Psychological Studies
          (M.A.) &amp; Marriage and Family Therapy (Ed.S.) from Seton Hall University. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in
          the State of New Jersey. I am a certified adult and youth yoga instructor. This paired with my knowledge of
          neuropsychological principles and the impact of stress, are the ideal combination for promoting wellness.

        <p>
          As a private practice owner, I provide individual, couple and family treatment, as well as yoga based wellness
          programming and private mindfulness coaching.

        <p>
          My therapeutic services are customized to meet the specific needs of each client/family. I am engaged throughout the
          entire therapeutic process and guarantee measurable results.

            As a couple, finding a therapist we both liked proved to be a challenge....until Janine. Janine is warm, insightful,
            full of compassion, and makes each session a safe place to be honest and vulnerable. We have seen a 180 degree turn
            in our relationship thanks to attending sessions with Janine (and doing the suggested exercises she gives us).
            Janine has our highest recommendation as a safe person and trusted therapist.

        <p>
          Building relationships that cultivate joy, connection and intimacy - one breath, one step, one day at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We often focus on curating the "perfect" wedding day, invitation, living space or social media post with/about our
          partner. Yet, rarely do we consider the skills we need to create a life together that is grounded in connection,
          communication and intention. My goal is to provide a space for you to collaboratively build the foundation for a
          lasting partnership.
        </p>
        <p>Begin your journey with relational alignment so you can flourish individually and together.</p>

            <h3>Who can benefit?</h3>
            <p>
              This program is for any partnership desiring to enhance their connection. Whether you are looking for a
              non-denominational pre-marital program or simply to expand your connection, this program is for you!

            <h3>The Skills</h3>
            <p>
              The first 6 sessions focus on skill building - expanding introspection, understanding attachment, engaging in
              healthy communication and enhancing connection. The result is more rewarding conversations, greater intimacy and
              the ability to effectively navigate inevitable conflicts.

            <h3>The Lens</h3>
            <p>
              Sessions 7-12 focus on understanding the lens through which each partner sees the world, as well as exploring what
              has shaped each partner's view of relationships. This expanded view allows for fewer misperceptions and
              miscommunications which can lead to disagreements and disconnection.
