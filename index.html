          <p>
            We often focus on curating the "perfect" wedding day, invitation,

            rarely do we consider the skills we need to create a life together
            that is grounded in connection, communication and intention. My goal
            is to provide a space for you to collaboratively build the
            foundation for a lasting partnership. Begin your journey with
            relational alignment so you can flourish individually and together.

            <h3>The Skills</h3>
            <p>
              The first 6 sessions focus on skill building—expanding
              introspection, understanding attachment, engaging in healthy
              communication and enhancing connection. The result is more
              rewarding conversations, greater intimacy and the ability to
              effectively navigate inevitable conflicts.

            <h3>The Lens</h3>
            <p>
              Sessions 7-12 focus on understanding the lens through which each
              partner sees the world, as well as exploring what has shaped each
              partner's view of relationships. This expanded view allows for
              fewer misperceptions and miscommunications which can lead to
              disagreements and disconnection.

            mindfulness and the principles of educational kinesiology yield
            powerful sessions which expand participants' ability to move through
            life's challenging moments.
