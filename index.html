            <p>
              For nearly 20 years, I have provided treatment across multiple
              settings including private practice, community mental health
              centers, hospitals, schools, yoga studios, and in-home treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              I obtained my B.A. in Psychology from Rutgers University, followed
              by graduate degrees in both Psychological Studies (M.A.) and
              Marriage and Family Therapy (Ed.S.) from Seton Hall University. I
              am a Licensed Professional Counselor in the State of New Jersey. I
              am a certified adult and youth yoga instructor. This paired with
              my knowledge of neuropsychological principles and the impact of
              stress, are the ideal combination for promoting wellness.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a private practice owner, I provide individual, couple and
              family treatment, as well as yoga based wellness programming and
              private mindfulness coaching. My therapeutic services are
              customized to meet the specific needs of each client/family. I am
              engaged throughout the entire therapeutic process and guarantee
              measurable results.

            foundation for a lasting partnership. Begin your journey with
            relational alignment so you can flourish individually and together.

            <p>
              The first 6 sessions focus on skill building—expanding
              introspection, understanding attachment, engaging in healthy
              communication and enhancing connection. The result is more
              rewarding conversations, greater intimacy and the ability to
              effectively navigate inevitable conflicts.

            <h3>The Lens</h3>
            <p>
              Sessions 7-12 focus on understanding the lens through which each
              partner sees the world, as well as exploring what has shaped each
              partner's view of relationships. This expanded view allows for
              fewer misperceptions and miscommunications which can lead to
              disagreements and disconnection.
